# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

It is named after a computer scientist named Barbara Liskov who explained this principle that she authored. The LSP Principle states -

__"Objects must be replacable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program."__

The _Is a_ way of thinking.

But there is a caveat. Let us take the Ostrich example. It cannot fly. Therefore it overrides the fly method and leaves it unimplemented. And this is a design
flaw.

Clearly, the ostrich cannot replace the bird since it didn't implement the fly method or there is no scope for implementing the fly method.

## Breaking the hierarchy

Let us take another example which will help us enforce the LSP principle.

We have implemented a racing car class which extends the car class. The racing car class overrides the getCabinWidth method and leaves it unimplemented,
because in racing cars you don't have `CabinWidth`, you have `CockpitWidth`. Therefore, it introduces a design flaw and leaves room for errors.

Take a close look at the following picture.

Now, if i implement another class called `CarUtils` which creates a list of cars and prints their CabinWidth, clearly when racing car class methods
are invoked, they are not going to produce any results as they are Unimplemented.

Let us create another class called Vehicle and increase the level of abstraction & let car/racing car's extend the vehicle class. And it looks as follows.

<img width="606" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 12 34 58 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34048837/142369073-7e167a66-9ba1-41d6-9111-a9f4af3c8cfc.png">

If you can see the above implementation, the RacingCar class and Car Class override `getInteriorWidth` method and return the width what is correct
according to their own class.

This code re-structring follows the LSP & let us look at the VehicleUtils class.

<img width="458" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 12 35 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34048837/142369384-53a5d9d1-8b2f-485a-ab46-59801ea335b8.png">

All calls work correctly and it is dynamic. By the way we designed the hierarchy, we can iterate through any no of objects of reference type Vehicle
and get the InteriorWidth without bothering about car objects or racing car objects.

This solution is called Breaking the hierarchy for implementing LSP.

## Tell, Don't ask

We have a generic product class and an Inhouse-product class.  (Amazon and Amazon Basics)
All products get 20% discount and the Inhouse-products get 30% discount.

If we examine the implementation of `InhouseProduct` class it doesn't override the `getDiscount` method, it rather
uses the existing discount and multiplies it by 1.5 times and returns the discount.

This is not a good design and clearly voilates LSP. You can feel it when you have examine the PricingUtils class.
If you observe the implementation, we __"ASK"__ if the product in the ListProducts List is an instance of InHouseProduct class and then
call the corresponding applyExtraDiscount method on that class object. This is a bad design.

You just have to __"TELL"__ the pricing utils class that all the list of the products are an extension of product class and you call the same method
on all of them and it should work. You don't have to typecast and check if a specific object is a InHouseProduct or not although this class extends
the same product class.

You can observe the following revised implementation.
We do not need to bother about the product types, therefore LSP is passed.
Objects can be substituted with their subtypes without worrying about the correctness of the program.

## Wrap Up

Remember the Break the hierarchy and Tell, Don't Ask patterns to deal with design flaws and drive home the LSP.
