# Open Closed Principle

Software components must be closed for modification and open for extension.

Closed for modification means new features getting added to the software component, should NOT have to modify the existing code.
Open for extension means the software component must be extensible to add a new feature or a behaviour.

The following is an example of a gaming console which perfectly illustrates the open closed principle. If you have to play shooting games/racing games
you have additional accessories which can be used along with the remote provided with the console.

The console in itself is not open for changes. hence the gaming console is an appropriate example for open closed principle.

## A Code example

Let us take the example of a ficticious insurance company called `One State insurance`. 

<img width="655" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 12 32 56 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34048837/142267024-7d8998fe-5be8-4eca-9899-b556929c1912.png">

The insurance calculations are calculated as a Java library. This is a snippet of code taken from the library and it shows how premium discounts are calculated.

Let us say in the future `One State insurance` company acquires another company which primarily deals with vehicle insurance and now the tag line is also changed.
which means the business changed.

When the business changes the underlying software components that support the business also need changing as in, you need to calculate discounts for 
vehicle insurance customers as well. Let us assume the calculation is based on customer loyalty irrespective of which ever insurance it is. (vehicle, health or home).

Now, this is how one does it by violating the `open closed principle.` we simply add another class (for vehicle insurance customer profile) and modify the existing insurance discount
calculator class as follows by adding additional method. (method overloading).

This is just the beginning. What if we want to handle home insurance too ? We keep modifying the calculator class. Why is it not good ?
In order to add a new feature, we keep modifying or touching the existing code which goes against the open close principle.

## Refactoring for open close principle.

We will create a new interface called `CustomerProfile`. The interface defines only one method. And then we make our Vehicle and Customer Insurance
class objects implement the customer profile interface. And we modify the calculator class as well.

And now if new features are required for example home insurance, it is easy to extend without modifying or touching the existing code.
And we obey the open close principle.
