# Interface Segregation Principle

__No Client should be forced to depend on the methods that it does not use.__

## An Example Indicating Violation of ISP

As a software developer you have been tasked to develop interfaces for fax/printer/scanner devices in the office. You need to represent the devices via OOPS.
You start off designing a common interface based on this All-In-One device. (Xerrox MultiFunction Device)

Next you create a class that represents the device after implementing the common interface.

Next you came across two devices which does everything apart from fax and another device which does only printing.

If you are implementing interfaces you must implement all methods of the interface.
Unimplemented methods are almost always the case of a poor design. Goes against the ISP Principle.

But you come up with the implementations.

## Fixing for ISP

Why is this a bad design ?

The device classes are packaged as a library in some employee portal. One programmer sees the fax method on the Cannon Device and invokes it.
He doesn't care to look at the unimplemented method. This is calling for trouble.

This is the reason why ISP calls out one must avoid it.

The solution is as follows:

You create different interfaces by splitting the common interface.

And you re-write the classes and get rid of methods which have blank implementations.
Now, there will be no ambiguity.

This is one way of implementing the ISP.

## Techniques to Identify voilations of ISP.

FAT interfaces - Interfaces with a high number of methods. Almost indicative of voilation of LSP.
Interfaces with Low Cohesion - Example, the Fax & Scan are entirely two different functions/cater to two different responsibilities.
Empty Implementations of Methods - Look for concrete classes which doesn't implement some methods.

You can also deduce that from the above example, the software components (Interfaces -> IPrint, IScan and IFax) abide by SRP.
And take an concrete class for example, CannonPrinter class, you can easily substitue it for IPrint interface which abides by LSP.

In that way, fixing ISP also fixes LSP/SRP.
