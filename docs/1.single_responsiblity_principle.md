# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Every software component (class, method or even a function) should have one and only one responsibility.

## Cohesion

It is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related.

To increase the cohesion, we split up the methods and create two classes as show below.

The `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` inside the class `Square` have a high cohesion because they deal with the `side` of the square.
The `draw` and `rotate` methods inside the class `SquareUI` have a high cohesion because they deal with graphical aspects of the square.

High Cohesion helps attain better adherence to the SRP.
In this example, the single responsibility of `Square` class is to deal with the measurements of the square.
the single responsibility of `SquareUI` class is to deal with graphical rendering of images of squares.

## Coupling

It is the level of inter-dependency between various software components.

Tight coupling of different rail engines to their tracks. However in the software world, tight coupling of software components is not a desired feature.

In the following example, we can see that the student class is tightly coupled with the a backend database. Just as the train is tightly coupled to its track.
In future if there is a need to change the backend database, you need to re-write the entire piece of code for the `save` method.

Now, the following is a better implementation of the loose coupling.

Loose coupling helps attain better adherence to the SRP.
In the above example the `Student` class has the single responsibility of handling core student data. The `StudentRepository` class has the single responsibility
of handling database operations.

Low Cohesion is bad.
Tight Coupling is bad.

Encourage Higher Cohesion and loose copuling.
