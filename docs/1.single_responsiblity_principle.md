# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

__Every software component (class, method or even a function) should have one and only one responsibility.__

## Cohesion

It is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related.

To increase the cohesion, we split up the methods and create two classes as show below.

The `calculateArea` and `calculatePerimeter` inside the class `Square` have a high cohesion because they deal with the `side` of the square.
The `draw` and `rotate` methods inside the class `SquareUI` have a high cohesion because they deal with graphical aspects of the square.

High Cohesion helps attain better adherence to the SRP.
In this example, the single responsibility of `Square` class is to deal with the measurements of the square.
the single responsibility of `SquareUI` class is to deal with graphical rendering of images of squares.

## Coupling

It is the level of inter-dependency between various software components.

Tight coupling of different rail engines to their tracks. However in the software world, tight coupling of software components is not a desired feature.

In the following example, we can see that the student class is tightly coupled with the a backend database. Just as the train is tightly coupled to its track.
In future if there is a need to change the backend database, you need to re-write the entire piece of code for the `save` method.

Now, the following is a better implementation of the loose coupling.

Loose coupling helps attain better adherence to the SRP.
In the above example the `Student` class has the single responsibility of handling core student data. The `StudentRepository` class has the single responsibility
of handling database operations.

Low Cohesion is bad.
Tight Coupling is bad.

Encourage Higher Cohesion and loose copuling.


## Reason for Change

__Every software component (class, method or even a function) should have one and only one reason to change.__
Software is never dormant and it keeps changing.

No of changes is directly proportional to no of bugs. Take the following example.

<img width="486" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-16 at 4 48 48 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34048837/141976177-945b9bb9-31d1-40c8-836a-57de6b30d8c3.png">

More bugs may mean more downtime which can cause financial impact. Therefore not following the SRP can cause financial impact.

<img width="732" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-16 at 4 45 18 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34048837/141975755-14ffc629-141b-4749-a67a-cbe3c2061de3.png">

Therefore, the SRP is not just a fancy principle, its an important design principle in software architecture which when not followed can cause
huge financial or business impact.

Now, ensuring the SRP principles we try to reduce the reasons to change to a unity.

Although there are two reasons to change for the `Student` class, it can be read as a single reason `Change in the Student Profile`. The reason for combining these
two is because they are closely related.

Another Example:-

Since the SRP states that each and every software component (In this example the Employee class) must have a single reason for change, move out the taxCalculator
and save methods into their own classes as shown below.

<img width="470" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-16 at 4 59 08 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34048837/141977645-7b90c06b-e405-4a37-96b2-7576ce008709.png">

This doesn't mean that you need to create 'n' number of classes everytime. As long as you can group the methods/pieces into a single responsibility in a sensible
way, you are good to go.

## Wrap Up

SRP
Aim for High Cohesion and loose coupling.
Following SRP can lead can lead to slashing down considerable software maintenance costs.
