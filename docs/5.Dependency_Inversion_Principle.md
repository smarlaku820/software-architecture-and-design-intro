# Dependency Inversion Principle

__High level modules should not depend on Low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.__

__Abstractions should not depend on details and details must depend on abstractions__

## High Level and Low Level Modules

Let us first understand the terms used in the definition. Say you are running an e-commerce website. The software is sophisticated. It contains 10's of thousands
of lines of code. But a high level view would be like this.

The modules at the top are closer to business functions (HIGH LEVEL) and the low level modules are closer to implementation details. (LOW LEVEL).
The communication software module is both high and low level depending on the context and is relative in nature. If you bring in the CustomerProfile into the context, then
`CustomerProfile` is the high level module and Communication is the low level module. If you bring in the `EmailSender` and `VoiceProfile` then its a high level module.

Now, if we focus on `ProductCatalog` & `SQLProductRepository` sample code snippets it feels like the `ProductCatalog` depends on `SQLProductRepository`
which clearly violates the DIP.

How do we fix it ? The principle states that both the high level and low level modules must depend on abstractions.
An interface is an abstraction. And we can make the `SQLProductRepository` implement the methods in the interface `ProductRepository`.

Now, we must make the HighLevel use the low level repository somehow and it must not directly instantiate the lowlevel repository.
we do that with the help of factory class.  And this is how the factory class looks like. It has a single method create which will instantiate and return 
SQLProductRepository object.

So, `ProductCatalog` depends on `ProductRepository` Interface
And `SQLProductRepository` depends on `ProductRepository` Interface. so there are no direct dependencies between the high level and low level modules.

## Abstractions and details.

If you observe the diagram below, the dependency reversed after we have Low Level Module `SQLProductRepository` implement the interface or depend on the interface.
This exact reversal of relationship is what the second principle is talking about. Abstraction must not depend on details(`SQLProductRepository`). 
Details(`SQLProductRepository`) must depend on abstractions.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is not Dependency Inversion Principle.

In the above example we used the factory class to get the instance of `SQLProductRepository` class. Even though the responsibility of instantiating a low level 
class is handed over to the factor class still the onus of triggering the instantiation process relies with the `ProductCatalog` Class.

Ideally we don't want the `ProductCatalog` to worry about how/when to instantiate the `SQLProductRepository` class.

What if we provided instantiated `ProductCatalog` the instantiated class without it even asking ?

Implement a construct for the `ProductCatalog` class which takes in a `productRepository` object. And we have a class with the main method that creates and
makes use of `ProductCatalog` class. It first calls the factory method and gets the `SQLProductRepository` instantiated and then invokes the constructor of
the `ProductCatalog` class by passing on the newly instantiated object.

So, now when the `ProductCatalog` is created it gets the `SQLProductRepository` object. 
`ProductCatalog` can use `SQLProductRepository` whereever and whenever it wants. `ProductCatalog` cannot worry about any instantiation. In otherwords, we are injecting 
dependency into the `ProductCatalog` class instead of `ProductCatalog` worrying about the instantiating the dependency. This is called the Dependency Injection.

This is an illustration that explains the dependency injection. All dependencies are being injected into the Apple from outside.
So, Apple can focus on its main function rather than have to worry about getting its own dependencies.

Dependency Injection not only avoids tight coupling it completely disassociates a class from getting its dependencies from outside.

## Inversion of Control (IOC)

Even though its not part of a dependency inversion principle, it is closely related.

In the previous example even though the dependency injection is occuring outside of the `ProductCatalog` class, the dependencies are being injected
during the "main" control flow of the program. ie., the injection is happening in the main thread of the program execution. 

What if you want all the injections to happen in a seperate thread ? or a seperate context all together ? So that the main control flow is kept
completely isolated from dependency injections ?

This can be achieved through __Frameworks__. The popular framework in Java is __Spring Framework__.
If your preferred programming language is Java then Spring framework is a popular choice.

Spring will run in its own context different from main flow of control of the program. Spring will take care of injecting dependencies of the class.
So, if you want to instantiate an object of a class instead of we doing us directly in the code, we ask Spring to give you an object of the class.

Spring first looks at all dependencies required for the object instantiation and injects the dependencies required for the object and gives it back
to the main control flow.

Thus the control over deps in is completely dedicated to the spring framework and does not happen in the main control flow. This is called the Inversion of Control
And spring is the IOC Container.
